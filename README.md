With this plugin, you will be able to see the following things:
- Track the following stats persistently(unless you reset them)
-- Total Fish Caught
-- Total Pearls Caught
-- Longest Dry Streak
-- Best Streak (Biggest Spoon)
-- Total Golden Tench Caught (Total Tench)

And there's more stats coming at you, this stats will be tracked for your session of Aerial Fishing.
Note: They will reset to 0 when the cormoront goes back to Alry, when you turn the plugin off and on, and when you log out.
- Fish Caught (Since last Molch Pearl)
- Session Fish (Fish caught this session)
- Last Pearl (How many fish it took to get the last Molch Pearl)
- Session Pearls (The number of Molch Pearls this session)
- Actual Rate (This is your ACTUAL Molch Pearl rate. Number of fish caught this session / Molch Pearls gained)
- Wiki Rate (This is the rate that can be found from the wiki. It uses your Fishing and Hunter level to determine the rate. 1/75 to 1/200)
- Tench Chance (The chance that you would have got at least 1 tench in the number of fish caught this session)

This version now also brings you the ability to reset the persistent stats below for a clean start:
