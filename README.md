# Aerial Fishing Pearl Luck Tracker

Are you a clogger that hates yourself because Aerial Fishing exists? Well, it's time to hate yourself more!

With this plugin, you will be able to see the following things:
- A counter that tracks the number of fish it takes to get a Molch Pearl;
- A counter that tracks how many fish you needed to catch for the last Molch Pearl;
- A counter that tracks your worst dry streak in getting a Molch Pearl. My highscore in testing was 310 fish caught for 1 Molch Pearl (: and;
- The percent chance that you should've caught a Golden Tench in your current session.

The dry streak will persist across your profile, whereas the other variables will reset with your session.
The plugin will only be active when you have the Cormoront's glove equipped.

Favorite it for easy access!
